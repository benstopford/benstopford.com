CAP is widely known and widely misunderstood. This isn't surprising. However it's probably ok. From what I can tell most people's understanding of CAP is really just an understanding that we can trade immediate consistency, something relational databases have made familiar, wiht eventtual consistency. If we make this tradeoff we will in some sense get better availability but we may get inconsistent data (i.e. data may be lost).
