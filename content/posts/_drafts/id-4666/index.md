So I'm going to try and explain Kafka, as I understand it, as succinctly as possible.

You're probably familiar with messaging. There are some standards for this, AMQP and JMS are the big ones. These have two core ideas: queues which deliver an ordered stream of events and topics which broadcast a stream of events to anyone listening.
