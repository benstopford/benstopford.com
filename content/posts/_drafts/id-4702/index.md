Here are a few topics that I think are interesting and are going to see some action in the next year or so.

 

Better transactional guarantees for distributed systems

 

Malleability in data environments will breed productivity gains

 

Stream based flows will become first class citizens

 

Reproducibility will become a domentant concern for data pipelines

 

Data curation and integration are sorely neglected, this will change. If data beats algorithms then integrating data sources quickly and efficiently is a holy grail
