title: "Trolling on Tech Management..."

A few hours after entering Yahoo’s complex for the first time Marissa Meyer famously set up her computer to log into the company’s code base so she could personally make changes, much like the founder of a tiny tech firm might do.

I can't help wonder where she was going with this. Did she really plan to spend time writing code? Maybe she just felt more comfortable having the code at her fingertips? Maybe it was a context thing, getting a feel for the place, how it worked, how it was structured? Maybe it was simply to curry favour with heavily tech-centric organisation?

It's hard to know her intentions, but it does seem unlikely that much profit would be gained from her actually writing software. She may well be able to fix a bunch of problems with her ninja coding skills but there are probably a swathe of far more qualified, well practiced and significantly cheaper engineers that could do this for her. Not because she’s not smart, but because they do it all day, every day, over many many years.

I'm picking on Marissa and that's not my intention. I've just noticed an increasing number of management types promoting an image of technical credibility with little gimmicks of different types. Something about this just doesn't ring true. It doesn't ring true because, as an employee, I don't really care that much about what they used to do. I care deeply though that they are good at what they do now. Part of that means 'getting' technical culture and technical people. Whether you solve the towers of hanoi in less than 5 minutes seems a little immaterial to that to me.  It also seems a little condescending that you think it does. 

This is probably as much our fault as it is their's. The valley's tech-centric culture promotes these ideals. Sure, we all like the idea of one of us, one of the best of us, conquering the ranks of Harvard MBAs and brutish, pointy-haired management types. It means they should be able to relate. That they should empathise with us. What we feel when we write software. That apparently inconsequential things, like having an operating system with more than a 32bit address space, are important to us. An appreciation for how bloody difficult software is. To have felt, first hand, the difference between a highly productive team on one that rolls along in mediocrity. Maybe we relate to their success with our own. 

But what really matters for management is that they are good at management. Management is about people, evaluating strategy and affecting change in an organisation. Good managers rely on advice from a variety of people who really understand the problems at hand. They udnerstand the systemic affects that occur in companies, be it knowingly or not. They show good judgment and inspire those around them. They may also be strategists, policy makers or technicians, but their real role is to make others great at these things.

That's not to say management shouldn't code. They should. But code for the love of it. Code because it gives you context and keeps you grounded. But do this for yourself. Not of for anyone else. Certainly not to curry favour. Instead embrace the role you do now. What you are supposed to be. Impress by creating awesome tech environments. Focus on the things that really matter: Hiring great engineers. Environments that embrace creativity and learning. Building products that are awesome. Having an achievable and well communicated strategy. Relish this. Be great at this. Be boastful of this.
