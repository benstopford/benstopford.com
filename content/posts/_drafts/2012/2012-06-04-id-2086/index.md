The web conatins much more than html. There is code, video, audio, images.. so how big is it all anyway?

**Web Pages on the Observable Web ~ 50PB**

Google trawled about 50 billion pages [in early 2012](http://www.worldwidewebsize.com/) (although there are more conservative estimates fo around 10PB). Using the fact that the average webpage is just under 1MB according to [the HTML Archive](http://www.extremetech.com/computing/110099-the-web-in-2011-html5-dominates-flash-trouble-for-data-capped-mobile-surfers) a little bit of maths takes to around 50 petabytes.

**Text on the Observable Web ~ 1PB**

Each page is about 4% HTML and 2% actual text (Unicode). In case you are wondering it’s mostly images and scripts.

**The whole thing = Zetabytes**

The full size of all-content on the internet is pretty hard to judge. The best estimates I’ve found are for [281 Exabytes in 2009](http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/the_coming_data_explosion.php), [500](http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2009/may/18/digital-content-expansion) and [800 Exabytes in 2010](http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2010/04/here-comes-the-zettabyte-age/).
