**The Future of Data Technology ([6th Nov 15.40](http://oredev.org/2015/sessions/the-future-of-data-technology))**

No longer does one-size-fit-all when it comes to data technology. At least not for many of today’s use cases. Will this ever change? Will we continue to diversify? Will we go full circle? Certainly ours is an industry in flux. NoSQL, Big Data and stream technology, containerisation, commodity PCIe storage, non-volatile memory and a host of other forces will shape the data technologies of the future. 

In this talk will make a case for what the future may look like, what challenges we’ll encounter and how it will likely change the applications we build. 

**Elements of Scale: Composing And Scaling Data Platforms ([5th Nov 14.20](http://oredev.org/2015/sessions/elements-of-scale-composing-and-scaling-data-platforms))**

Today there are a host of data-centric challenges that need more than a single technology to solve. Data platforms step in, blending different technologies to solve a common goal. 

But to compose such platforms we need an understanding of the tradeoffs of each constituent part: their sweet spots, how they complement one another and what sacrifices they make in return.

This talk is really a grand tour of these evolutionary forces. We’ll cover a lot of ground, building up from disk formats right through to fully distributed, streaming and batch driven architectures. In the end we should see how these various pieces come together to form a pleasant and useful whole.
