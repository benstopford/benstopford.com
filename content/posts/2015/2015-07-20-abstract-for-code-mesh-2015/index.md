**Contemporary Approaches to Data at Scale (tbc)**

We use a host of tricks these days for handling data at scale. Disk structures are tuned to specific workloads. Streams are used to create continuous pipelines of processing. Hardware offers incredible diversity in terms of latency and throughput.

The tools available: Cassandra, Postgres, Hadoop, Kafka, Hazelcast, Storm etc all come with tradeoffs unique to themselves. We’ll look at these as individual elements. We’ll also look at compositions that leverage these individual sweet spots to create more powerful, holistic platforms.
