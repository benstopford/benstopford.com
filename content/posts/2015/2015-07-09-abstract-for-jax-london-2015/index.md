**Intuitions for Scaling Data-Centric Architectures ([14th Oct 11.20](https://jaxlondon.com/session/intuitions-for-scaling-data-centric-architectures-2/))**

This talk will examine the various intuitions and trade-offs needed to scale a data-centric application or architecture. Building from the fundamentals of data locality, immutability and parallelism, attendees will gain a sense for how fully blown architectures can be sewn together. The result: a balance of real-time storage, streaming and analytics that plays to the relative strengths of different component parts.
