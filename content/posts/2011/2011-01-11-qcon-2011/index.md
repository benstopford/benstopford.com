Just a little plug for the [**5th annual QCon London**](http://qconlondon.com/london-2011/conference/ "blocked::http://qconlondon.com/london-2011/conference/") on March 7-11, 2011. There is a bunch of cool speakers inlcuding [Craig Larman](http://qconlondon.com/london-2011/speaker/Craig+Larman) and [Juergen Hoeller](http://qconlondon.com/london-2011/speaker/Juergen+Hoeller) as well as the obligitory set of Ex-TW types. I'll be doing a session on [Going beyond the Data Grid](/2011/01/27/beyond-the-data-grid-building-a-normalised-data-store-using-coherence/).
