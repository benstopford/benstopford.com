This test is designed for the Business Analyst interview process. Like all tests it covers a core skill. In this case writing up a requirement/story. However, like the developer test ([here](/2010/10/14/the-iffy-tractor-can-they-code-oo/)), it probes something specific in a bit more detail; whether they think about the existing system, not just the requirement to be covered. The test is short and simple:

> Online Calculator
> 
> We have some developers who are working on an online calculator. Currently the site only supports add, subtract and equals. The users are looking to add multiplication to the application. Write a use case to describe this work which could be presented straight to the developers.

Obviously this provides an opportunity to show they can write. Does the BA know how to structure a requirement/story, can they articulate themselves etc? However the test goes a little deeper than that. The average candidates will jot down a story that describes how the new functionality (the multiplication button) should be developed. Better candidates will take into account existing functions in the system, describing how their new function should relate to the existing ones. For example they'll specify how the multiplication button behaves when it is pressed after each of the other functions or numbers. Better ones still will refer to BODMAS etc.
