Here are four articles that provide an introduction to Oracle Coherence. They cover what Coherence is good for (it's not a magic bullet) as well as introducing the key ideas and functions you need to know about.

Introductory:

- [I: An Introduction](/2009/03/04/oracle-coherence-part-i-an-introduction/)
- [II: Delving a Little Deeper](/2009/05/16/oracle-coherence-part-ii-delving-a-little-deeper/)
- [III: The Tool Box](/2009/07/19/oraclecoherence-part-iii-the-coherence-toolbox/)
- [IV: Merging Data and Processing](/2009/08/29/oraclecoherence-part-iv-merging-data-and-processing/)

More Advanced:

- [Performing Joins in the Cluster](/2009/11/20/how-to-perform-efficient-cross-cache-joins-in-coherence/)
- [Balancing Replication and Partitioning with Star Schemas](/2011/05/09/efficiently-modelling-normalised-data-in-coherence-using-star-schemas/)

Stuff that can trip you up:

- [Problems with Affinity and the Coherence Threading Model](/2009/08/30/the-trials-of-merging-data-and-processing-in-coherence-why-it-doesnt-quite-just-work/)
- [Why Coherence Queries don't Scale](/2009/12/12/coherence-the-falacy-of-linear-scalability/)
